## Abstract
Wi-Fi connectivity, a necessity in this digital era, requires careful infrastructure planning and tuning during installation. In this paper, we propose “Aparecium Wi-Fi Planner”, an open-source and cross-platform, Wi-Fi planning software tool based on an enhanced empirical path loss model. The proposed “Enhanced Solah's model” delivers more accurate results than existing models. And hence, “Aparecium Wi-Fi Planner” accurately estimates path loss attenuation, absorption attenuation by obstacles and fading effect. Moreover, the tool integrates the design and development of several algorithms to find full-coverage and optimal access point location with reduced complexity. Aparecium has been thoroughly tested and validated using both simulation and real testbed scenarios.
