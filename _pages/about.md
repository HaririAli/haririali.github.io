### About me
I am a PhD student specialising in the field of dynamic authorisation and continuous usage control.
I am specifically working on session and state management in distributed Usage Control as well as data flow and process control.
I received my Master of Science (MSc.) degree from the university of Kent in the UK where I worked on IoT security and discovered a minor vulnerability in home security kits.
I completed a Bachelor of Engineering (BEng.) degree in computer and communications at the Islamic University of Lebanon, where I studied a wide variety of topics from telecommunications and electronics to computer networks and programming. 

Apart from research, I worked as a software engineer for a while and had some experience in network engineering and system administration.
I also work with a friend on some side projects such as mobile applications and open-source projects, in which I usually take care of backend APIs and DevOps.

When I'm not working, I'd probably be watching a movie or a series, or riding my bike and taking landscape photos.
I also enjoy reading and learning about other scientific areas such as astrophysics, neurobiology, psychology and philosophy.
Although I'm introverted, I'd love to meet and connect with people, so drop me a message on any of my social media if you'd like to have a chat ;)

I am planning to add more content to this website and to explain some of my work in blog posts, so stay tuned if interested :))
